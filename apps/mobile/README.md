## Stack Suggestion

- TypeScript

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd apps/mobile
   npm install
   # or
   yarn
   # or
   pnpm install
   ```

2. Start the Expo server:

   ```

3. Follow the Expo CLI instructions to open in a simulator or on your device.

## Structure
